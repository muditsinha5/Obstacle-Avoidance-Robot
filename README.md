# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
The robot is capable of avoiding obstacles and change its path as soon as it detects any obstacle.The robot detects the object with the help of ultrasonic sensor and changes its path or direction accordingly.
This robot makes decision to go left or right based on program logic that can easily be changed according to requirements.
This robot contains: 
Arduino: It is a microcontroller that controls the robot and its movements.
Ultrasonic sensor: It detects the obstacle. 
Motor driver IC L298D: This driver is used to control and drive DC motors.
Lithium ion battery: It gives power supply to robot (approx: 7.5V).

The code is given in this repository.
